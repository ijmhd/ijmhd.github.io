This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the interdisciplinary field that combines fluid dynamics and electrodynamics. Students will explore the fundamental principles, equations, and applications of MHD in contexts such as space plasma, astrophysics, and fusion research. The course is structured to balance theoretical foundations with practical applications, preparing students for advanced study or research in related areas.

## a. What is Magnetohydrodynamics?

Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) combines the fundamentals of fluid dynamics and electrodynamics, which is used extensively in physics and engineering applications, including but not limited to, fusion plasma, space plasma, solar physics, astrophysics and mechanical engineering. The physical picture behind MHD is actually more comprehensive than its complicated theoretical formulism. Within the space physics community, MHD and its extensions are used in studying the physics of ionospheres, magnetospheres, and interaction between different physical regions.

## b. Why Magnetohydrodynamics?

So why MHD?

- An important part of basic plasma physics  
- Used extensively in space plasma applications  
- Promising tools for space weather (or nonsense) research  
- Its numerical implementation is artistic (or crap)

So which textbooks?

- *Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics*  
- *Plasma Physics*  
- *Introduction to Magnetohydrodynamics*  
- *Physics of Plasmas*  
- *Auroral Plasma Physics*

## c. Class Structure

- There will be two lectures per week  
- Students are recommended (but not required) to read the lecture notes and related chapters/topics before the corresponding lecture notes prior to attending class  
- There will be one homework assignment every week, due before class one week from the assignment.  
- No final exams unless you want one.
