collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper is a numerical experiment on the role of ionospheric O+ ion outflow on sawtooth oscilattions, namely whether the location of the source outflow population determines the occurence of sawtooth oscillations. The short answer is no'
