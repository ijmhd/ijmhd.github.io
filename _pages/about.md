<!--Hey there, welcome to my corner of the web!-->

<!--img src="IMG_3591.png" alt="drawing" width="200" style="float: right"/-->

I'm a space physicist :beer::beer::beer:, which basically means I get to use supercomputers to build virtual solar systems. I create simulations to understand the forces, fields and particles that fill the space around planets (including our own!). This "space weather" can knock out satellites and disrupt communications, so my digital lab is on the front lines of predicting these cosmic storms to help protect our tech, and of course, future missions to other solar planets (or exoplanets...)

My Cosmic Playground
=====
Our main project grew from a classic code called the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM), a master piece of work done by Professor John Lyon from Dartmouth. Think of it as the engine for our digital universe. My team and I have been upgrading it into a general-purpose tool for simulating the flow of space plasma. Our current playground includes the Sun's atmosphere, the solar wind, and the magnetic environments of Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. The dream is to keep adding new worlds—maybe Mars, the ice giants, or Krypton.

## Want to Join the Fun?
Calling all students who love a good math puzzle and aren't afraid of physics! If the idea of coding up simulations of Jupiter's magnetosphere or the solar wind gets you excited, I'd love to hear from you. There's always room on my team for curious minds, and I'm especially keen to tackle new, ambitious, and exciting problems. Let's build something cool together.
