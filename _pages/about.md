<!--Welcome to my page on the web!-->

I'm a space physicist:beer: working on the development of first-principles, high-performance computing based numerical tools for understanding the dynamic evolution of our space environment, a.k.a., the geospace, The changing geospace environment affects activities such as communication an d operation of space systems, which is known as space weather. The computational tools developed through my research projects are potentially promising for the prediction of space weather that impacts our daily life.

What I'm working on
=====
<img src="gamera_sq.png" alt="drawing" width="200" style="float: right"/>

Started from a pioneer MHD code called the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM), my colleagues at Johns Hopkins University and I have developed a general-purposed code GAMERA (the LFM re-invented, name after a prominent Japanese Kaiju) solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). GAMERA stays mostly inside the solar system, occupying the Solar corona, Inner Heliosphere, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn Neptune. Maybe Mars, Uranus in the future.

## PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
If you are a student with a broad interest in modeling space plasma environments and with a general love for applied math and science, feel free to contact me. There are plenty opportunities within my current projects/collaborations given the set of scientific tools I'm working on with my colleagues, and I'm always keen to get started on something new, difficult and exciting.
